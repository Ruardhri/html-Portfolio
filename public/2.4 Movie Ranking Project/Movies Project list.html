<p>Suspense and tension bleed within in this movie, it slowly dripfeed out information enticing your attention 
to the plot and characters with every word of dialogue with visuals and direction to match it's unassuring 
feeling. it explores the human psyche, who are we, when stripped of our restraints are we just animals?</p>
<h3>2. In the mood for love Dir. Wong Kar-wai (2000)</h3>

<p>A beautiful film centered on our silent secrets that we so wish to hide in a moment. Society forces our
lies so when we find someone who we can whisper to; to swim with us in our truth what do we feel? Humans are 
not puzzle pieces ones pain will not fit anothers but in our shared pain we paint a beautiful scene.</p>
<h3>3. Ratatouille Dir. Brad Bird (2007)</h3>

<p>This movie just clicks on a staisfying level the script is written so that we can pick up on all these quips
and snarks people make and the acting only enforces onto this. We can view how people get what they want and 
push onto eachother. Emotions are on show. It manages to make the story of a bunch socially awkward startup founders
so engaging. </p>
<h3>5. Stalker Dir. Andrei Tarkovsky (1979)</h3>

<p>Desire, interest and the bare truth of human behaviour are all put to display. Is what we desire what we 
truly want? Can satisfaction be truly achieved? Are we chained to live in our pointlessness, the fight between
meaningless existence and desire holds us in circles of survival.
